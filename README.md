# rust-scripts

A set of Rust scripts I use to automate different tasks on my home server

Just run `make` to install scripts to `/usr/local`.

## Disclaimer

These are home-made scripts, not intended for wide use, so I'm not responsible
for any problems/losses/failures due to use or misuse of these scripts.
Also, I made these scripts for my *personal* use, so I'm not going to add features
or fix things I don't need, so don't even bother to ask me.
And yes, the code is not perfect, I know it, and I don't worry about it.
It's for home use, remember?

I share them to showcase things one can do with Rust, to allow new Rustaceans to
learn something from them, and to let other people build their own automation
solutions based on these scripts.
